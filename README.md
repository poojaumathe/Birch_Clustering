We have a loans dataset to perform BIRCH clustering. 
In this analysis, we will observe different clusters in our dataset. 
The hardness of the problem is to be able to find the clusters in this very large dataset.

The following methodology is applied to find the clusters.

Importing the dataset
Train/ Test splitting
Standardizing
